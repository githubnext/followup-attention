# ANALYSIS PASSES
# this are routines which takes the extracted attention tensor from the model
# and perform some operations/analysis on it, producing new derived artifacts
# in the `analysis_data_folder`.
# e.g. compute the follow-up attention or the entropy of the attention tensor
# each funtion takes a 6-dimension tensor as input and produces its output
# in a new folder called with the analysis pass name
# this analysis passes can also take json files as input. Depending on the file
# contained in the input_folder. The filetype should be the same for all the
# files in the input folder.
