# Attention Wizard

This folder contains all the attention-related toolkit, to process the
attention weights.

Some common operations include:
- visualizing the attention weights on the source code
    - one weight per token -> via heatmap on the source code
    (using the code-attention-visualizer PyPi package)
    - multiple weights per token -> via heatmap matrix
- converting the token on byte-level attention to the token level attention
