# timestamp when the participant STARTS looking at the code for the

# the following two fields are to determine the correspondence between the real
# pc time and the relative time of the recording
# this is extracted by looking at the window clock in the bottom right corner
# of the video and see when it changes the minutes.
# we then report both the relative time at a precise minute change and the pc
# clock time.

# precise PC clock time (bottom right corner). This is the new starting minute.
# REMEMBER TO USE THE 24 hour format. Note that this represents:
# hours and minutes unlike the rest of the field.

# add positive number if the eye-tracker data is faster than the video
# add negative number if the video is faster than the eye-tracker data
