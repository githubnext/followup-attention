This notes help to trace where the these files were originated in the original run.

1. The folder `cmp_v06` contains the comparison csv generated for all the models, check the config files in `config/comparisons/cmp_v06*` for the exact configuration used for the different models.
2. The folder `eye_v10` is contains the metadata regarding how much time has been spent on each token (using tokens of different models). For more details check the config files in `config/eye_v10*` for the exact configuration used for the different models.

Note to reproduce these analysis from scratch use the readme and the `.sh` scripts in the main folder of the repository.
