**Purpose**: We would like to observe you while using VSCode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools. The purpose of this observation is to inform us how developers approach make sense of source-code. We are trying out our new eye tracker hardware to measure the effectiveness of our code editors - experimenting with alternative design for Intellicode and Copilot. In addition, we are investigating the Visual Studio ‘getting started experience’ for source control – looking at how we might improve the learning/onboarding process. Results of this study may be used for academic publications. 

**Activities**: The study activities include observing you accomplishing a set of tasks about the code in VSCode IDE environment and completing a questionnaire before and after this process. We will audio-record and screen capture your actions for transcription purposes. If you are not willing to be audio-recorded or have your actions screen captured, please do not participate. The session is expected to run for approximately 30 minutes.

**Benefits**: There are no direct benefits for participating in the study. However, the study may help improve the usability of VSCode IDE tools.

**Confidentiality**: It is possible that others could learn that you participated in this study but the information you provide will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. It is possible that these records could contain information that personally identifies you. To help protect your confidentiality, we will identify your data only by code number, and records tying you to the code number will be destroyed after data collection for the study. All data will be stored in a secure location.

**Voluntary**: Participation in this study is voluntary. You can skip any of the questions that you do not wish to answer. Your participation or non-participation will not have an impact on your relationship with Microsoft/GitHub or your job.

**Compensation**: We will offer $10 cafe cards for your time on completion of the study.
